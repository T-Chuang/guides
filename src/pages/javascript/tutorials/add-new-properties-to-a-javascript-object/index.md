title: Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
---
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them. The are two different syntax, dot notation and bracket notation. Dot notation is generally preferred for readability but properties must be a valid identifier. Here is how:

    myDog.bark = "woof-woof";
    myDog["favorite activity"] = "Chasing cats";
    myDog[1] = "American Eskimo";
